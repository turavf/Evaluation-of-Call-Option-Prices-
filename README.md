In this paper, Monte Carlo reduction variance techniques are studied in order to approximate the value of European Call options. Simulation modeling provides an important and key tool for analysis and insights into complex mathematical systems. Control variates reduce simulation errors by applying variance reduction techniques. After the analysis needed to acquire the knowledgment, a code in Python was created with the intention of comparing the results and concluding which technique was the most accurate.
